# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Tank Terror

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Tank game where a bunch of tanks are fighting against each other in a maze. Players can move on to different maps and mazes. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a player game in which u control a tank and the goal is to be the last one standing. My software will have simply tanks spread out in the map and will be 2D. This will be executed using unity as the library. The features won't be too complicated and just have a simple layout. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Nafiz - tur53400@temple.edu - Tomoya Kanno
Josh - tus92665@temple.edu - Tomoya Kanno

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will accomplish the tank features and the maze and at least another level to the game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is we get to personlize the game. Maybe instead of tanks it is our faces. Or instead of mazes there are completely differeny maps. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The Best outcome is that we personlize the tanks and have multiple levels with completely different maps. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Skills we need to acquire are how to create a game with unity and how to be callaboritive on github. Topic we need to research are unity and similiar tank games. I will focus more on the game maps and gameplay. Josh will help me with gameplay and focus pn tanks. Nafiz will focus on the personloization of the project to make it our own.
